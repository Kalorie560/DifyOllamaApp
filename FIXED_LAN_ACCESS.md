# LAN Access Fixed

The ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED error has been resolved by fixing several key issues:

## What Was Fixed

1. **Ollama Configuration**
   - Configured Ollama to listen on all network interfaces (0.0.0.0) instead of just localhost
   - Changed systemd service configuration to use OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434

2. **Nginx Configuration**
   - Fixed syntax errors in the nginx.conf file
   - Properly configured CORS headers
   - Added proper handling for OPTIONS requests
   - Ensured proper forwarding to backend services

3. **Docker Configuration**
   - Updated port mappings to expose services on all interfaces (0.0.0.0)
   - Fixed environment variables to use the correct IP address

4. **Network Binding**
   - Verified all services are listening on 0.0.0.0 (all interfaces)
   - Created proper host-to-container routing

## Verification Tools

Several scripts have been added to help maintain and test the setup:

1. **test_connectivity.sh**
   - Tests connectivity to all services both locally and over LAN
   - Verifies port bindings and service responses
   - Checks firewall settings

2. **repair_services.sh**
   - Comprehensive fix for all services
   - Rebuilds configurations from scratch
   - Restarts services with correct settings

3. **check_status.sh**
   - Reports on current service status
   - Shows running containers and port mappings

## Access URLs

You can now access all services from any device on your LAN:

- Dify Web UI: http://<your-host-ip>:3000
- Dify API: http://<your-host-ip>:5000
- Ollama API: http://<your-host-ip>:11434

## Important Notes

1. When configuring Ollama in Dify from another device, use your host's IP address (e.g., http://192.168.1.16:11434), not "localhost" or "host.docker.internal"

2. Status codes to expect:
   - 200: Success (Ollama API, specific Dify API endpoints)
   - 307: Redirect (Dify Web UI - this is normal)
   - 404: Not Found (Dify API base URL - use specific endpoints)

3. If issues return in the future, run:
   ```bash
   sudo ./repair_services.sh
   ```
